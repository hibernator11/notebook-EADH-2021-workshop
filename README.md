## A Medical History of British India
These examples are based on the dataset ['A Medical History of British India'](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections/a-medical-history-of-british-india/) provided by the [Data Foundry](https://data.nls.uk). It uses the trial data version of the dataset (15.5 MB compressed). This dataset forms the first half of the Medical History of British India collection, which itself is part of the broader India Papers collection held by the Library.

The examples include the following Jupyter notebooks:

- Exploring the [CSV file](nls-text-indiaPapers/indiaPapers-inventory.csv) indiaPapers-inventory.csv [Preview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-EADH-2021-workshop/blob/main/Exploring_Medical_History_of_British_India-csvfile.ipynb)
- Frequency Distribution Plot [Preview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-EADH-2021-workshop/blob/main/Exploring_Medical_History_of_British_India-freq.ipynb)
- Frequency Distribution Plot using stopwords [Preview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-EADH-2021-workshop/blob/main/Exploring_Medical_History_of_British_India-freq-v2.ipynb)
- Fulltext search example [Preview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-EADH-2021-workshop/blob/main/Exploring_Medical_History_of_British_India-search.ipynb)


## Data from RusAge
A CSV dataset created using data from [RusAge](https://www.kaggle.com/oldaandozerskaya/fiction-corpus-for-agebased-text-classification) (a corpus for Age-Based Text Classification Russian fiction books' previews with age rating labels) available at. The corpus consists of 5592 texts of childrenâ€™s and adult book previews (the folder "previews"). The corresponded book abstracts are placed in the folder "abstracts". The "Train" and "Test" folders contain train and test samples used in experiments. The file called ["descriptions.csv"](RusAge.csv) contains the description of our data and text age ratings.

The examples include the following Jupyter notebooks:

- Exploring the [CSV file](RusAge.csv) RusAge.csv [Preview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-EADH-2021-workshop/blob/main/Exploring_RusAge-csvfile.ipynb)
- Fulltext search example [Preview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-EADH-2021-workshop/blob/main/Exploring_RusAge-search.ipynb)

## Data from FantLab Library (https://fantlab.ru/)
A [CSV dataset](FantLab-data-Kaggle.csv) created using data from FantLab Library and [available online](https://www.kaggle.com/karinaagafonova/fantlab-library/version/1?select=FantLab+data+-+for+Kaggle.csv). The data is based on 11 genres from FantLab Library (https://fantlab.ru/) including the title, author, year of publication, the language of the publication, main characteristics, genre, subgenre, place of action, time of action, plot goal, plot linearity, recommended age, annotation, total voters, total votes, average rating, gender and age histograms.

The examples include the following Jupyter notebooks:
